# Sift-based Object Detection
We implemented the SIFT algorithm presented in this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:VISI.0000029664.99615.94) for detecting an object that had 2 modes. One was the car mode and another was the humanoid mode.

## Results:

## Tools and Frameworks

**IDE:** VS Code <br>
*(Any IDE of choice may be used)*

**3rd party libraries:**
- OpenCV 4.2

**Software Modelling Tool:** Star UML <br>
*(The deployment diagram that describes the modular design of the code and how the different nodes interact with each other was created using this software)*

## Usage

If you would like to run this code make sure it is in the same directory as the Data_Set Repository. To run the code just run at the main.P why file. If you would like to change the image change the path location in the __name__==’main’ function.
The GenerateDatabaseInfo.py file is meant to create the database of model keypoints and should not neeed to be run.


	```bash
	$ python3 main.py
	```
